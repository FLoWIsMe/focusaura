# FocusAura

**AI focus assistant that senses distraction and brings you back into flow.**

## Overview

FocusAura is an intelligent Chrome extension that watches for distraction events (like switching to YouTube mid-work session) and responds with personalized, science-backed micro-interventions powered by You.com's real-time intelligence APIs.

When you drift, FocusAura catches you‚Äîgently‚Äîand shows you exactly what to do next, backed by live research and actionable advice.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- Chrome browser

### Running Locally (Full Stack)

**Option 1: Development Mode (Recommended for Testing)**

Open two terminal windows:

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
cd extension
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser to **http://localhost:5173** and test the full flow!

The backend API docs will be available at **http://localhost:8000/docs**

---

**Option 2: Chrome Extension Mode (Production-like)**

**Step 1 - Start Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

**Step 2 - Build Extension:**
```bash
cd extension
npm install
npm run build
cp public/manifest.json dist/
cp public/icon*.png dist/ 2>/dev/null || true
```

**Step 3 - Load in Chrome:**
1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top-right corner)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the `extension/dist` folder
5. Click the FocusAura extension icon in your Chrome toolbar

---

### Testing the Demo

1. **Set a goal**: "Finish Section 2 by 3 PM"
2. Click **"Save Goal"**
3. Click the yellow **"üé¨ Simulate Distraction (Demo)"** button
4. Watch the **FocusCard** appear with personalized intervention
5. Click **"I'm back"** to log recovery and see metrics update

### Current API Implementation

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: The MVP uses **template-based responses** for the demo. Real You.com API integration requires:

1. Get API key from You.com hackathon organizers
2. Create `backend/.env` file:
   ```bash
   YOU_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
3. Uncomment TODO sections in `backend/you_client/*.py` files
4. Replace dummy returns with actual API calls

This approach allows you to demo the full UX flow immediately without waiting for API credentials.

## Security & Privacy Positioning

**FocusAura does NOT capture or transmit:**
- Raw document text
- Screenshots
- Keystroke content
- URLs with sensitive query params

**FocusAura ONLY sends:**
- Abstract context: e.g., "user worked 42 minutes on 'strategy doc', then switched to YouTube"
- User's stated goal: e.g., "Finish Section 2 by 3 PM"

This minimal data model enables powerful interventions while respecting user privacy.

## Why This Matters for You.com

FocusAura is a living showcase of You.com's mission: **search ‚Üí reason ‚Üí act** in real time, for a single human, at the moment they need it most.

Traditional search is pull-based: you go to the engine. FocusAura is push-based: the engine comes to you, precisely when your brain needs a reset, with research-backed advice synthesized from the entire web in under 500ms.

This is the future of agentic search‚Äîcontext-aware, proactive, and human-centered.
