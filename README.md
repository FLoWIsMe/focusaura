# FocusAura

FocusAura is an Chrome extension with AI focus assistants that watches for distraction events (like switching tabs mid-work session) and responds with personalized, science-backed micro-interventions powered by http://you.com's real-time intelligence APIs.

When you drift, FocusAura catches youâ€”gentlyâ€”and shows you exactly what to do next, backed by live research and actionable advice.

## Quick Start
### Running Locally

**Option 1: Docker**

```bash
# From project root
docker compose up
```

Backend runs at `http://localhost:8000`. See [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md) for full Docker documentation.

**Option 2: Chrome Extension Mode**

**Step 1 - Start Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

**Step 2 - Build Extension:**
```bash
cd extension
npm install
npm run build
cp public/manifest.json dist/
cp public/icon*.png dist/ 2>/dev/null || true
```

**Step 3 - Load in Chrome:**
1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top-right corner)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the `extension/dist` folder
5. Click the FocusAura extension icon in your Chrome toolbar

### Testing the Demo

1. **Set a goal** 
2. Click **"Save Goal"**
3. Click the yellow **"ðŸŽ¬ Simulate Distraction (Demo)"** button
4. Watch it appear with personalized interventions.

## Security & Privacy Positioning

**FocusAura does NOT capture or transmit:**
- Raw document text
- Screenshots
- Keystroke content
- URLs with sensitive query params

**FocusAura ONLY sends:**
- Abstract context: e.g., "user worked 42 minutes on 'strategy doc', then switched to YouTube"
- User's stated goal: e.g., "Finish Section 2 by 3 PM"

This minimal data model enables powerful interventions while respecting user privacy.

## Why This Matters for You.com

FocusAura is a living showcase of You.com's mission: **search â†’ reason â†’ act** in real time, for a single human, at the moment they need it most.

Traditional search is pull-based: you go to the engine. FocusAura is push-based: the engine comes to you, precisely when your brain needs a reset, with research-backed advice synthesized from the entire web in under 500ms.

This is the future of agentic searchâ€”context-aware, proactive, and human-centered.
