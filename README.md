# FocusAura

**AI focus assistant that senses distraction and brings you back into flow.**

## Overview

FocusAura is an intelligent Chrome extension that watches for distraction events (like switching to YouTube mid-work session) and responds with personalized, science-backed micro-interventions powered by You.com's real-time intelligence APIs.

When you drift, FocusAura catches youâ€”gentlyâ€”and shows you exactly what to do next, backed by live research and actionable advice.

## Architecture

```
Chrome Extension (React)
    â†“
    [Distraction Event: user switched to youtube.com]
    â†“
FastAPI Backend
    â†“
    [Calls You.com APIs in parallel]
    â”œâ”€â†’ Web Search API (evidence-based focus techniques)
    â”œâ”€â†’ News API (recent neuroscience studies)
    â””â”€â†’ Smart/Research API (personalized synthesis)
    â†“
    [Fused intervention returned as JSON]
    â†“
Chrome Extension
    â””â”€â†’ Shows FocusCard overlay with nudge
```

## Local Development

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

The FastAPI server will run on `http://localhost:8000`. Visit `/docs` for the interactive API documentation.

### Extension Setup

```bash
cd extension
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then load the extension in Chrome:
1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode"
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the `extension/dist` folder (generated after build)

For development, you can test the intervention flow using the "Simulate Distraction" button in the popup UI.

## Security & Privacy Positioning

**FocusAura does NOT capture or transmit:**
- Raw document text
- Screenshots
- Keystroke content
- URLs with sensitive query params

**FocusAura ONLY sends:**
- Abstract context: e.g., "user worked 42 minutes on 'strategy doc', then switched to YouTube"
- User's stated goal: e.g., "Finish Section 2 by 3 PM"

This minimal data model enables powerful interventions while respecting user privacy.

## Why This Matters for You.com

FocusAura is a living showcase of You.com's mission: **search â†’ reason â†’ act** in real time, for a single human, at the moment they need it most.

Traditional search is pull-based: you go to the engine. FocusAura is push-based: the engine comes to you, precisely when your brain needs a reset, with research-backed advice synthesized from the entire web in under 500ms.

This is the future of agentic searchâ€”context-aware, proactive, and human-centered.
