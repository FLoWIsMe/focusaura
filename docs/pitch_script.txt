FocusAura Pitch Script
Hackathon Demo (90 seconds)

[SCENE 1: THE PROBLEM - 20 seconds]

You're deep in flow, 42 minutes into writing your project proposal.

Then—a notification. YouTube. Just one video.

23 minutes later, you're watching "Top 10 Most Expensive Yachts."

Your deadline? 3 PM today. The cost of that distraction? Real.

[SCENE 2: THE SOLUTION - 30 seconds]

This is FocusAura.

An AI focus assistant that senses the moment you drift—
and brings you back, gently, with science-backed interventions.

[Show extension icon → distraction event → FocusCard appears]

Not generic advice. Personalized guidance, synthesized in real time from:
→ You.com Web Search API: evidence-based techniques
→ You.com News API: recent behavioral science studies
→ You.com Smart/Research API: personalized synthesis

All in under 500 milliseconds.

[SCENE 3: THE DEMO - 30 seconds]

Watch.

[Click "Simulate Distraction" button]

→ FocusAura detects I switched to YouTube
→ Calls backend → You.com APIs reason over the context
→ Returns: "Take a 90-second walk—no phone."

[FocusCard appears with intervention]

Action. Reasoning. Citation. My goal, restated.

[Click "I'm back"]

→ Recovery logged. Minutes saved: 6.

[SCENE 4: THE VISION - 10 seconds]

FocusAura is search, reimagined.

Not pull-based. Push-based.

Not reactive. Proactive.

The right answer, at the right moment, for the person who needs it most.

This is the future You.com is building.
