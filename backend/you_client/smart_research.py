You.com Smart/Research API Client

This module queries You.com's Smart/Research API to synthesize
information from web search and news results into personalized,
context-aware advice for the user.

This is the "reasoning" layer that turns raw search results into
actionable micro-interventions tailored to the user's specific situation.

async def query_smart_research(research_query: Dict) -> str:
    """
    Query You.com Smart/Research API for synthesized, personalized advice.

    Args:
        research_query: Dict containing:
            - user_context: User's goal, time on task, distraction type
            - web_findings: Results from web_search.py
            - recent_studies: Results from news_search.py
            - synthesis_prompt: Natural language prompt for synthesis

    Returns:
        String containing synthesized, personalized intervention advice

    TODO: Actual Implementation
    ---------------------------
    1. Get You.com API key from environment variable
    2. Construct synthesis prompt that includes:
       - User context (goal, time on task, distraction)
       - Findings from Web Search API
       - Recent studies from News API
       - Request for personalized action
    3. Call You.com Smart/Research API endpoint:
       - This API uses LLM-powered synthesis
       - It should reason over the provided context
       - Return a single, coherent recommendation
    4. Parse response to extract:
       - Primary recommended action
       - Reasoning grounded in the provided research
       - Confidence/relevance score
    5. Return formatted string for final intervention composition

    Example API call structure:
    ```python
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.post(
            "https://api.you.com/smart",
            headers={"X-API-Key": api_key},
            json={
                "query": research_query["synthesis_prompt"],
                "context": {
                    "web_results": research_query["web_findings"],
                    "news_results": research_query["recent_studies"]
                }
            }
        )
    ```

    This API is key to FocusAura's value proposition:
    Instead of showing generic advice, we synthesize real-time research
    into a single action personalized to THIS user at THIS moment.
