    1. Get You.com API key from environment variable
    2. Construct search query:
       Example: "evidence-based focus recovery after distraction neuroscience"
    3. Call You.com Web Search API endpoint
    4. Parse response to extract:
       - Top 3 most credible sources (edu, peer-reviewed, reputable)
       - Actionable techniques with brief explanations
       - Source citations
    5. Return formatted string for compose_intervention to use
